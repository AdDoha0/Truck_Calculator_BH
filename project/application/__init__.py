Application layer - orchestrates domain operations.

This layer contains:
- Use Cases (application-specific business logic)
- DTOs (data transfer objects for boundaries)
- Application services (coordinate domain services)

The application layer depends on the domain layer but is independent
of infrastructure and UI concerns.
